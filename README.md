Customer Behavior Analysis
Project Overview

This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns and behaviors to uncover insights that can help improve sales strategies, customer retention, and marketing effectiveness.
It involves data preparation in Python, data exploration using SQL, and visual storytelling with Power BI.

Discount Applied	Whether a discount was used
Promo Code Used	Whether a promo code was applied
Previous Purchases	Number of previous transactions
Payment Method	Mode of payment used
Frequency of Purchases	How often the customer shops

Data Preparation (Python)

Performed data cleaning and transformation using Pandas and NumPy:

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized categorical data

Converted data types for analysis

Created new features (e.g., purchase frequency categories)

Exported the cleaned dataset for SQL and Power BI use

Research & Analysis (SQL)

Used MS SQL Server for exploratory and analytical queries to answer business questions such as:

Which age group spends the most?

What product categories are most popular by gender or season?

How do discounts and promo codes affect purchase amounts?

What is the relationship between subscription status and review ratings?

Which payment methods are most frequently used by high-value customers?

Visualization (Power BI)

Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights such as:

Sales distribution by category, season, and location

Customer segmentation by age and gender

Impact of discounts and promotions on sales

Correlation between review rating and repeat purchases

Key KPIs (Average Purchase Value, Total Revenue)

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

MS SQL Server

Power BI

Excel (initial data validation)

Key Insights

Younger customers (18–30) made frequent low-value purchases, while older customers (40+) had higher purchase amounts.

Apparel and electronics were top-performing categories across most regions.

Customers using promo codes had higher purchase frequency.

Subscription members showed better loyalty and higher average ratings.

Outcome

This analysis provided actionable insights into customer segmentation, marketing optimization, and sales growth strategies.
It demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics process — from raw data to interactive insights.
